OpenH264
OpenH264 is a codec library which supports H.264 encoding and decoding. It is suitable for use in real time applications such as WebRTC. See http://www.openh264.org/ for more details.

Encoder Features
Constrained Baseline Profile up to Level 5.2 (Max frame size is 36864 macro-blocks)
Arbitrary resolution, not constrained to multiples of 16x16
Rate control with adaptive quantization, or constant quantization
Slice options: 1 slice per frame, N slices per frame, N macroblocks per slice, or N bytes per slice
Multiple threads automatically used for multiple slices
Temporal scalability up to 4 layers in a dyadic hierarchy
Simulcast AVC up to 4 resolutions from a single input
Spatial simulcast up to 4 resolutions from a single input
Long Term Reference (LTR) frames
